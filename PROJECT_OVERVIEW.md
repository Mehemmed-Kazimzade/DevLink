🚀 📌 DevLink — Core Concept

What is DevLink?
A modern platform where developers can:

    Build and share a professional dev profile

    Showcase projects & code snippets

    Ask/answer technical questions

    Join tech-focused groups & collaborate

    Track personal goals & progress

It combines the community aspect of LinkedIn + knowledge-sharing like StackOverflow + project repo elements from GitHub — but all developer-focused.

    Optimistic updates (React Query)

    Error boundaries for fallback UI
